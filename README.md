Hi! My name is **Michael Miriti**, and I'm a software developer driven by a lifelong passion for programming.

I created my first program somewhere at the very beginning of the millennium, and to this day, I write code almost daily â€” not only for work but, most importantly, for the fun of it.

I have a great passion for **game development**. After all, it was the whole reason I got into programming. One day, I will release the game of my dreams, but in the meantime, I mostly make little games for fun. Check out my itch.io page: [miriti.itch.io](https://miriti.itch.io).

I'm working on a little game engine called [RES](https://github.com/RES-Haxe/res). It's written in **Haxe**, which is one of my favorite programming languages.

I also have a mission of creating the best productivity timer ever. It's called [Flow Petals](https://flowpetals.app/).

I'm an **Open Source** and **Linux** advocate (_using Arch, by the way_).
